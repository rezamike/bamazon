So this is a node program for buying products using server data, built to be utilized as both the "customer" and "manager".

The customer is able to view, and buy. The manager is able to view, track low inventory, add quantity of product, and add a new product. All of these are meant to run through a node localhost server. 

These popular movie props are good for decoration, or as a gift to your pop-geek friends.
