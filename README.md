So this is a node program for buying products using server data, built to be utilized as both the *customer* and *manager*.

The __*customer*__ is able to:
* View Items
* Buy Items

The __*manager*__ is able to:
* View Items
* Track Low Inventory
* Add Product Quantity
* Add New Product

All of these are meant to run through a node localhost server. 

These popular movie props are good for decoration, or as a gift to your pop-geek friends.

Please install npm:
```javascript
"chalk": "^2.4.1",
"inquirer": "^6.2.0",
"mysql": "^2.16.0",
"request": "^2.88.0",
"require": "^2.4.20"
```
